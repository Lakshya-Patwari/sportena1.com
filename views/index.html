            <h2>Cricket</h2>
            <p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players on a field with a central 22-yard pitch.\n
                The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or hitting boundaries,\n
                while the bowling and fielding team tries to dismiss the batters and limit runs.\n
                 A bowler delivers six balls in an "over," and fielders assist in catching or stopping the ball.\n
                  Common ways to get out include being bowled, caught, run out, or LBW (Leg Before Wicket). </p>

            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>Football, or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opposing team's net while preventing the other team from scoring.

Matches are typically 90 minutes long, split into two 45-minute halves, with a possible additional time for stoppages or extra time in certain situations. Common rules include offside, fouls, and penalties, and the team with the most goals at the end wins!</p>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a fast-paced game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end. The goal is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop while preventing them from doing the same. A game is typically played in four quarters, each lasting 10 or 12 minutes. Players can pass, dribble, or shoot the ball, but must not move without dribbling (called "traveling"). Points are awarded based on where the shot is taken: 2 points for regular shots, 3 points for long-range shots, and 1 point for free throws. Common rules include fouls for physical contact and violations like double dribbling. The team with the most points at the end wins!</p>

            <h2>Table Tennis</h2>
            <p>Table tennis, also called ping pong, is a fast-paced game played on a rectangular table divided by a net. It can be played in singles (1v1) or doubles (2v2). Players use paddles to hit a lightweight ball back and forth, aiming to score points by making the ball bounce on the opponent's side in a way they cannot return. A game is typically played to 11 points, with players needing a 2-point lead to win. Each player serves alternately for two points, with the ball tossed upward and struck so it bounces on both sides of the table. Key rules include no touching the table and ensuring the ball hits the opponent's side after every shot. The first to win a predetermined number of games (usually 3 or 4) wins the match!</p>

            <h2>Badminton</h2>
            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net, either in singles (1v1) or doubles (2v2). Players use racquets to hit a shuttlecock over the net, aiming to land it in the opponent's court or force an error. A point is scored if the opponent fails to return the shuttlecock or hits it out of bounds. Matches are typically played as the best of three games, with each game going to 21 points (a 2-point lead is required to win, up to 30 points maximum). Players serve diagonally, and the serve alternates after each rally. Key rules include staying within boundaries, no double hits, and the shuttle must not touch the ground. The first to win two games wins the match!</p>

            <h2>Athletics</h2>
            <p>Athletics is a collection of sports that involve competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking. Events are typically divided into track and field categories: track events (like sprints, hurdles, and relays) and field events (like long jump, high jump, shot put, and javelin). The basic rules vary by event but generally focus on completing the task in the fastest, furthest, or most accurate manner. In running events, athletes race to the finish line within a designated lane, and false starts result in disqualification. In jumping events, athletes aim for the greatest distance or height, while in throwing events, the goal is to propel the object the furthest. In walking events, participants must maintain contact with the ground at all times. Athletes are usually awarded points based on their performance, and the athlete with the best result wins!</p>
